#Inventory-Bins

This program simulates inventory bins
at a warehose. Each bin holds a 
number of items or the same type of
parts. This program uses a structure 
that keeps the following: 
description of the part kept in the bin
Number of parts in the bin.

The program has these functions:


AddParts: a function that increases a specific bin's part 
count by a specified number

RemoveParts: A function that decreases a specific bin's part count by a specific number.

The program repeats a loop that performs these steps:
The user should see a list  of what each bin holds and how many pieces there are.
The user can choose to either quit the progam or select a bin.
When the bin is selelcted, the user can either add parts to it or remove parts from it.
The loop repeats showing the updated data on the screen.
