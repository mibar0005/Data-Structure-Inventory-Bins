Program Planning:

Array:
This program should have an array of 10 bins.
Initialize the array with a part description and a number of units in the bin

Algorithm: 
1. Create and initialize an array of 10 bin structures 
2. Enter into the loop and continue until the user does not select a bin
3. Read the user input for a bin and ask to add or remove parts.
4. Cal the appropiate method to addParts or removeParts
5. Calculate the number of parts in the bin.
6. Verify that total number of parts are between 0 and 30

Input Validation: No bin can hold more than 30 parts, do not accept negative values of parts being added or removed.
